2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Linux and it's design philosophy are derived from the Unix philosophy. The Unix philosophy operates under the assumption that the user would have some initial computer literacy. The Unix philosophy also seems to be very modular, where each program is assigned a single task. The output of one program is expected to be the input of another program. To be honest, this philosophy seems to draw strong parallels with what we have been learning about method design and class structure. 

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* A VPS is a server that is hosted online as opposed to being a physically-existing server. It exists as a virtual machine; a collection of memory that exists to run an operating system, host files and essentially exist as a computer without the physical hardware.

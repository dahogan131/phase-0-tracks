Release 0:

* My game plan for tackling jQuery is to set a limit on the time invested on rabbit holes and being conscious of when it is time to take a break. 
	*I'm thinking I can work an hour at a time, with a break in the middle. With rabbit holes, my plan is to initially spend 15 minutes pursuing it. After 15 minutes, I determine if I am frustrated or constructively pursuing it. I also look at the remaining material and determine if the rabbit hole I am pursuing is absolutely neccessary to continue with learning jQuery. 
* One of my cohort-mates posted a very comprehensive jQuery cheat sheet, so I will be utilizing that. I have also had a lot of luck with Stack Overflow during this course, so I will be utilizing that as a resource. Will also use youtube. Youtube is very useful. 

* Each new concept, I feel it is important to stop and test. If I run into issues building something up and I did not test the prior concepts properly, it is going to be more difficult to troubleshoot the problem. 

Release 1: 

*Taking deep breaths, taking breaks and maintaining the problem-solver mindset were the foundation of the learning process. From there, I got a lot of information from the jQuery cheat sheet posted by my cohort mate and utilizing that resource was very helpful. I learn the best by doing, so I decided to work through jQuery and figure out how to modify html and css. Googling solutions really helped, but YouTube tutorials were the most helpful. I seriously learned a lot just by coding along and understanding how to establish jQuery in an html and how to use it to modify classes and id's.

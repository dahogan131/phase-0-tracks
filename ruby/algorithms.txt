*Pivot frame 90 degrees on the x and z axis that make up the lateral area of the bed. Front-facing edge of lateral plane.
*Position legs from knee-portion down off the lateral area of the bed and position 90 degrees downward on y-axis. 
*Perform concurrent motion of body from knees to back away from and off the lateral area of the bed, while the y-axis of the body forming a straight, up-and-down formation.

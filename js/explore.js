//Establish a function that accepts a string as a parameter.
//The function will be composed of a loop that runs until the index of the string parameter is equal to zero.
	//In the loop, the index of the string decreases by 1 each loop
	//In the loop there is a variable that represents an empty string.
		//Each loop cycle, the character of the string index is added to the empty string.

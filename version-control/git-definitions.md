# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control manages and records changes made to a file, document or program. It is useful in running multiple versions of a program and be able to identify bugs, which may exist on some versions and not others.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplicate of a code or program. You would use a branch to create variations of a source code to later test and debug without immediately modifying the "master" branch.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is the component of version control that manages changes to programs, code, documents, etc. A commit "saves" the changes to the repository. A good commit message is short but detailed. Ex: We make text in our file blue --> git commit -m "Implement blue text"
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you are trying to merge branches and there are commits in one branch that are not in the other branch.
